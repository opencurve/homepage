              <p class="lead">Curve is a distributed storage system designed and developed independently by NetEase, featured with high performance, easy operation, cloud native. Curve is composed with CurveBS(Curve Block Storage) and CurveFS(Curve FileSystem). CurveBS supports snapshot, clone, and recover, also supports virtual machines with qemu and physical machine with nbd. CurveFS supports POSIX based on Fuse.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Features</h3>
            <p>So far, we have implemented a high performance block storage system(CurveBS) and a basic file system(CurveFS). CurveBS supports snapshot, clone and recovery, and it can be attached to QEMU virtual machine or physical machine (by curve-nbd). CurveBS has been served as an elastic block storage service inside NetEase for a certain time, during which high performance and reliability have shown.CurveFS supports POSIX base on Fuse, and it has passed more than 8000 posix interface tests of pjdtest</p>
